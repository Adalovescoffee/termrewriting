# Term Rewriting 
 
 A fast-ish term rewriting system  in rust, with focus/goal on knuth bendix completion algorithm 
# TO-DO: 

- [x] terms 
- [x] parser implementation
- [x] apply axioms/rewrite rules on terms 
- [x] order of complexity 
- [x] subsumption order 
- [ ] find critical terms 
- [ ] superposition 
- [ ] ... 
- [ ] Knuth Bendix completion algorithm 
- [ ] solving word problem for finitely presented groups 
- [ ] finding grobner base
