# Term Rewriting 
 
An experimental library to learn about term rewriting system with goal to implement Knuth-Bendix algorithm in Rust. 

# TO-DO: 

- [ ] terms 
- [ ] apply axioms/rewrite rules on terms 
- [ ] find critical terms 
- [ ] superposition 
- [ ] ... 
- [ ] Knuth Bendix completion algorithm 
- [ ] solving word problem for finitely presented groups 
- [ ] finding grobner base
